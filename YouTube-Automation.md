# Automating YouTube Video Creation and Publishing

This document summarizes a comprehensive workflow for automating the creation, scheduling, and monitoring of YouTube videos. It breaks the process into multiple phases.

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- Define niche and video format.
- Design a spreadsheet template with columns for subject, topic, question, options, answer, explanation, strategy tips, and upload date.
- Plan video structure and collect branding assets.
- Create a YouTube channel and obtain API credentials.
- Set up an email account for notifications.

## Phase 2: Development Environment
- Install Python and necessary packages (e.g., `moviepy`, `pandas`, `openai`, `gtts`, `ffmpeg`).
- Use version control with Git.
- Set up a testing environment and optional orchestration tool such as n8n or Zapier.

## Phase 3: Content Generation Modules
- Read questions and metadata from the spreadsheet.
- Generate scripts and voiceovers using GPT or templates.
- Create strategy tips and store final narration scripts.

## Phase 4: Video Creation Modules
- Generate question slides, add timers, animate answers, and combine voiceovers.
- Attach intro and outro clips and export the final MP4 file.
- Keep a local backup of each video.

## Phase 5: Thumbnail Automation
- Generate thumbnails with DALL·E or Canva API and overlay text.

## Phase 6: Upload & Metadata Automation
- Prepare titles, descriptions, and tags.
- Upload via the YouTube Data API, starting as *unlisted* and checking for copyright issues before publishing.

## Phase 7: Scheduling & Orchestration
- Schedule uploads (e.g., five videos per day) while respecting API quotas.
- Control publication times for optimal reach.

## Phase 8: Logging & Monitoring
- Record each video’s subject, title, upload date, YouTube ID, and status in a local log (CSV or SQLite).
- Send daily email summaries with success or failure notifications.

## Phase 9: Notifications
- Use an SMTP service to email video links, publish status, and any errors.
- Optionally send weekly statistics.

## Phase 10: Continuous Improvement
- Connect to the YouTube Analytics API to track views, watch time, likes, and comments.
- Update the spreadsheet with performance metrics and adapt strategies accordingly.

## Additional Considerations
- Backup data, manage API keys securely, and handle rate limits.
- Provide captions for accessibility and a standard legal disclaimer in descriptions.
- Maintain a staging channel for testing and consider community engagement automation.
